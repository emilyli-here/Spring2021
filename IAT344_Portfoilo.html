                                    <p> For Pre-production, I assisted in the building the story based on the ideas Corissa and I discussed over voice calls. I built a rough script and logline to accompany our narrative film. We wanted to show something that is positive despite being in a pandemic. <em>"Look on the bright side</em> In addition to the script, I helped Corissa with building our storyboard and moodboard. I assisted her in adding tranistions and explaining the different scenes. The mood of our film is to be a comedic and ultimately leaving a “feel-good” positive effect on our audience.</p>

                                    <p>Shooting from home was a added challenge in our project. Without the luxury of having the option to rent eqiuipment from the school like in IAT 202, we had to improvise with the equipment we have at home. I used my old Canon DSLR and inexpensive mount shot gun microphone to film. The challenge in filming was I couldn't monitor the audio recorded on the microphone to the camera and we didn't have proper lighting equipment. Most of the scenes we used a regular house lamp and some white sheer fabric to help light scenes.</p>

                                    <p>Visual Effects like tracking and animated timer helped convey our narrative better to the audience. We wanted to added a counter or timer on our rewind effect to indicate going back in time. At first I wanted to make the entire flashback memory portion a foggy image but it didn't look as nice, so I went reversing the footage and adding some sound effects. I warped the reverse footage to move like the person is actually reversing a back into a memory. I think the effect was very successful and was really fun to make in the process. </p>

                                    <p>I took on the reponsibility of putting the main footages together and editing the audio for our film. From our feedback sessions, we got a lots of positive responses and some critical feedback. I had to cut down the beginning scenes to make faster and shorter so emphasive the prcess of our protagonist learning the ukulele as the main objective. With the helpful tips, I was able to cut down a significant amount of footage and condense our film.</p>

                                <p>This project has been an experience I won't forget. The pandemic has definitely affected many lives and an emotional draining process. With this project, I was able to explore how different individuals took this time to improve themselves and learn new skills. Although it was nice in the beginning to have online classes and the flexibility of remote learning, it's hasn't been easy to stay on task and focus. I learned that you don't need all the fancy equipment to make a meaningful film. The "home video" quality really added to the realistic instance that we are in right now.</p>

                                <p>I think if I were to this again with the same equipment, I would really consider using more DIY objects. Because of the limited equipment we had, we couldnt do many of the panning or dolly shots with our shaky hands. In the end, we had to make changes to our storyboard and keep most of our shots on a tripod. If we were able to plan and test out different methods of creating this camera movements without the equipment, I think it would add more visual aesthetics to our film.
